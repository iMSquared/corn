# Setup

## Docker Setup

Refer to the instructions in [docker](./docker)

## Package Setup

### Isaac Gym

First, download isaac gym from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym) and extract them to the `${IG_PATH}` host directory
that you configured during docker setup. By default, we assume this is `/home/corn/isaacgym`, which maps to`/opt/isaacgym` directory inside the container.
In other words, the resulting directory structure should look like:

```bash
$ tree /opt/isaacgym -d -L 1

/opt/isaacgym
|-- assets
|-- docker
|-- docs
|-- licenses
`-- python
```

(If `tree` command is not found, you may simply install it via `sudo apt-get install tree`.)

Afterward, follow the instructions in the referenced page to install the isaac gym package.

Alternatively, assuming that the isaac gym package has been downloaded and extracted in the correct directory(`/opt/isaacgym`),
we provide the default setups for isaac gym installation in the [setup script](./setup.sh)
in the [following section](#python-package), which handles the installation automatically.

### Python Package

Then, inside the docker image (assuming `${PWD}` is the repo root), run the [setup script](./setup.sh):

```bash
bash setup.sh
```


To test if the installation succeeded, you can run:
```bash
python3 -c 'import isaacgym; print("OK")'
python3 -c 'import pkm; print("OK")'
```

## Assets Setup

We release a pre-processed version of the object mesh assets from [DexGraspNet](https://github.com/PKU-EPIC/DexGraspNet) in [here](https://huggingface.co/imm-unicorn/corn-public/resolve/main/DGN.tar.gz).

After downloading the assets, extract them to `/path/to/data/DGN` in the _host_ container, so that `/path/to/data` matches the directory
configured in [docker/run.sh](docker/run.sh), i.e.

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/data/DGN
tar -xzf DGN.tar.gz -C /path/to/data/DGN
```

so that the resulting directory structure _inside_ the docker container looks as follows:

```bash
$ tree /input/DGN --filelimit 16 -d     

/input/DGN
|-- coacd
`-- meta-v8
    |-- cloud
    |-- cloud-2048
    |-- code
    |-- hull
    |-- meta
    |-- new_pose
    |-- normal
    |-- normal-2048
    |-- pose
    |-- unique_dgn_poses
    `-- urdf
```
# Evaluate CORN

Move to `pkm/scripts/train` and execute following command-line:

```bash
PYTORCH_JIT=0 python3 show_ppo_arm.py +platform=debug +env=icra_base +run=icra_ours ++env.seed=56081 ++eval_period=-1 ++tag=policy ++global_device=cuda:0 ++path.root=/tmp/pkm/ppo-a ++icp_obs.icp.ckpt=imm-unicorn/corn-public:512-32-balanced-SAM-wd-5e-05-920 ++load_ckpt=imm-unicorn/corn-public:dr-icra_base-icra_ours-ours-final-000042 ++env.num_env=1024 ++env.use_viewer=0 ++draw_debug_lines=0
```

If you want to see the behavior of policy, adjust number of parallel environment by changing `++env.num_env={num_env}` and turn on the gui with `++env.use_viewer=1 ++draw_debug_lines=1`

For detailed setup, please refer [README](./pkm/scripts/train/README.md).

# Pretraining

Navigate to the pretraining directory in `pkm/scripts/pretrain` and follow the instructions in the [README](./pkm/scripts/pretrain/README.md).

# Policy Training

Navigate to the policy training directory in `pkm/scripts/train` and follow the instructions in the [README](./pkm/scripts/train/README.md).

# Real World Experiments

## Sim2Real Distillation

Before running the real-world experiments, we distill the privileged teacher into a student that can operate with observations available in the real world.

See the related scripts and documentation in the [README](./pkm/scripts/train/README.md#sim2real-teacher-student-distillation).

## Real World Deployment

Navigate to the real-world deployment directory in `pkm/scripts/real` and follow the instructions in the [README](./pkm/scripts/real/README.md).
